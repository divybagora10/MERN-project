The user clicks a "Login with Google" button, which triggers the /google route.
They are redirected to Google to authenticate and grant permissions.
After authentication, Google redirects the user back to your app at the /google/callback route.
If authentication is successful, a JWT is generated for the user.
The user is redirected to the frontend with the JWT in the URL, so it can be used to maintain the session.
